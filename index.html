            We were all set on Thursday morn,<br>
            To get to the farm and harvest some corn<br>
            With luggage in hand and eager to go,<br>
            The flight was delayed because of snow.<br>
            In Minneapolis we finally arrived<br>
            Late and tired, but glad to survive<br>
            Do not drive, the radio warned<br>
            But we had to go get that corn.<br>
            We have a  buick, who needs a truck<br>
            Drive through the storm, we won’t get stuck!<br>
            the going got tough and we had to choose<br>
            Should we keep on driving or stop to snooze?<br>
            The Happy Chef looked good to us all<br>
            We knew in the morning we’d make the right call.<br>
            It’s a new day and mom’s at the wheel<br>
            Southward bound, she’s full of zeal.<br>
            Passing snowplows and bucking those drifts<br>
            Until that burning smell we started to sniff.<br>
            We stopped at Lake Crystal to decide what to do,<br>
            We soon met the doctor and the Skipper, too.<br>
            Let’s get in the car and go to my house<br>
            Wait a minute, Weldon, where’s your spouse?!<br>
            We just needed shelter, we weren’t choosy,<br>
            But we were pleasantly surprised to find a jacuzzi!<br>
            Two days later and we’re on our way<br>
            Let’s get to the farm for at least one day<br>
            Four hours later and we’re close to the place,<br>
            Poor mom had to walk with wind in her face.<br>
            A good night’s sleep and then met Bruce<br>
            We didn’t stay long, had to get home for goose!<br>
            That corn still stands, but what can we say?<br>
            We’ll have to come back and get it in May!
